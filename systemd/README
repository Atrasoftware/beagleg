Support to start BeagleG using systemd.

Just modify according to your taste, then
  sudo make install

Copy your configuration file to /etc/beagleg.config

Pretty basic right now; Questions (as I am more comfortable with SysV init:)
  * is it an ok practice to have a start script like run-beagleg.sh which then is
    called from systemd ?
  * What is the recommended service to depend on so that the uio_pruss module
    is properly loaded ? Right now this is happening manually.
